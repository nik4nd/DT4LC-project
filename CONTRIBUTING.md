### Pre-commit Setup

We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality before pushing changes. Make sure all hooks pass before submitting your work.

Install and enable the hooks:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

To run manually on all files:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Hooks included:

- **ruff** – lints and auto-fixes Python and stub files (`--fix` enabled by default)
- **ruff-format** – formats Python and stub files
- **mypy** – static type checking using config from `pyproject.toml`, with stubs for `requests` and `PyYAML`
- **trailing-whitespace** – removes trailing whitespace
- **end-of-file-fixer** – ensures files end with a newline
- **check-yaml** – validates YAML file syntax
- **check-toml** – validates TOML file syntax
- **check-merge-conflict** – detects unresolved merge conflict markers
- **debug-statements** – flags leftover `pdb`, `breakpoint()`, and similar debug calls
